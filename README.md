## About

Following the successful deployment of the Matrix AI Network’s first major update in August, the Matrix team is happy to announce that a third major update is ready! It brings with it third major new features. They are: snapshot and data storage optimization. This article will outline  snapshot and data storage optimization.

### Snapshot

Using the officially available snapshot version, you can start at 861265 based on snapshot + simplified data after booting.The data size is 11G, and the original synchronization to 861265 requires 200G.

### Data storage optimization     

 Do not use the above snapshot mode to start, use this version to boot from the genesis block, the database file downloaded before the block height 861260 can be optimized 25% than the previous version

### Getting Started
Welcome! This guide is intended to get you running on the MATRIX network. To ensure your client behaves gracefully throughout the setup process, please check your system meets the following requirements:


| OS        | Windows, Linux                               |   |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|---|
| CPU       | 8 Core (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU X5670 @2.93GHz) |   |
| RAM       | 16G                                          |   |
| Free HD   | 300G                                         |   |
| Bandwidth | 20M                                          |   |
|           |                                              |   |

### Build from Source

First of all, you need to clone the source code from MATRIX repository:

Git clone https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/go-matrix.git, or

wget https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/go-matrix/archive/master.zip

- Branch: Master

- Tag: v1.1.5

Building gman requires both a Go (version 1.7 or later) and a C compiler. You can install them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run your 'make gman' command 

You can also obtain our compiled gman from github [https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/GMAN_CLIENT/tree/master/MAINNET/0816](https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/GMAN_CLIENT/tree/master/MAINNET/0816)



### Starting up your member nodes (Linux & Mac) - for deposited users

Step 1: Check out what you need to prepare (most of them can be obtaind from go-matrix repository)

    /gman: exe file

    /MANGenesis.json: genesis file

    /chaindata: a folder which you should create

    man.json: common profile which shall be put under /chaindata

Step 2: Run Initiate command

    ./gman  --datadir  ./chaindata/   init    ./MANGenesis.json

Step 3: Visit our web wallet to create a new wallet address, and save your keystore file as well as password.

Please refer to [['Guide to Web Wallet']](https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/MATRIX_docs/blob/master/ENGLISH_DOCS/MATRIX_Web_Wallet/MATRIX%20Online%20Wallet%20Manual.pdf)

Carry out your deposit actions if you want to run for a miner or validator node (you can find steps on the above guide)

Step 4: Copy your keystore file to folder keystore which is generated at Step 2 (/chaindata/keystore)

Step 5: Create a file named signAccount.json under root, and its content is like:

    [
      {
        "Address":" MAN.gQAAHUeTBxvgbzf8tFgUtavDceJP ",
        "Password":" pass123456"
      }

    ]
Then, run: 

    ./gman --datadir ./chaindata aes --aesin ./signAccount.json --aesout entrust.json

Upon the window prompt, you will be asked to set a password (which should contain upper-case letter[s], lower-case letter[s], number[s] and special character[s])

Step 6: Copy the generated entrust.json to root

Step 7: Start gman

    ./gman --datadir ./chaindata --networkid 1 --debug --verbosity 5  --manAddress [your man.address here] --entrust ./entrust.json --gcmode archive --outputinfo 1 --syncmode full 

    for example, 

./gman --datadir ./chaindata --networkid 1 --debug --verbosity 5 --manAddress MAN.gQAAHUeTBxvgbzf8tFgUtavDceJP --entrust ./entrust.json --gcmode archive --outputinfo 1 --syncmode full

In this step, you will need to input the password set in step 5.

Step 8: Run 'Attach': ./gman attach /chaindata/gman.ipc (gman.ipc is generated under /chaindata when starting gman)


### Starting up your member nodes (Linux & Mac) - for non-deposited users

Step 1: Check out what you need to prepare (most of them can be obtaind from go-matrix repository)

    /gman: exe file

    /MANGenesis.json: genesis file

    /chaindata: a folder which you should create

    man.json: common profile which shall be put under /chaindata

Step 2: Run Initiate command

    ./gman  --datadir  ./chaindata/   init    ./MANGenesis.json

Step 3: Start
    ./gman --datadir ./chaindata --networkid 1  --outputinfo 1 --syncmode 'full'

### Starting up your member nodes (Windows) - for deposited users
Step 1: Check out what you need to prepare (most of them can be obtaind from go-matrix repository)

    /gman: exe file

    /MANGenesis.json: genesis file

    /chaindata: a folder which you should create

    man.json: common profile which shall be put under /chaindata

Step 2: Run Initiate command

    gman.exe --datadir chaindata\ init MANGenesis.json

Step 3: Create a file named signAccount.json, whose contents are:

    [
      {
        "Address":"MAN.2skMrkoEkecKjJLPz6qTdi8B3NgjU ",
        "Password":"haolin0123"
      }

    ]

Step 4: Run:

    gman.exe --datadir chaindata aes --aesin signAccount.json --aesout entrust.json

Upon the window prompt, you will be asked to set a password (which should contain upper-case letter[s], lower-case letter[s], number[s] and special character[s])

Step 5: Start gman

    gman --datadir chaindata  --networkid 1 --debug --verbosity 5  --manAddress  MAN.2skMrkoEkecKjJLPz6qTdi8B3NgjU --entrust entrust.json --gcmode archive --outputinfo 1 --syncmode full

In this step, you will need to input the password set in step 5.

Step 8: Open another window

    gman attach ipc:\\.\pipe\gman.ipc 

gman.ipc is generated under /chaindata when starting gman)

### Starting up your member nodes (Windows) - for non-deposited users

Step 1: Check out what you need to prepare (most of them can be obtaind from go-matrix repository)

    /gman: exe file

    /MANGenesis.json: genesis file

    /chaindata: a folder which you should create

    man.json: common profile which shall be put under /chaindata

Step 2: Run Initiate command

    gman.exe --datadir chaindata\ init MANGenesis.json

Step 3: Start gman

    gman --datadir chaindata  --networkid 1 --outputinfo 1 -- syncmode full
